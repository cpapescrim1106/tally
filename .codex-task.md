IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Implement all features described in the plan
2. Create a Dockerfile for the project
3. Run 'docker build -t tally:test .' and verify it succeeds
4. Commit all changes with clear commit messages
5. Push to origin when done

CRITICAL: The docker build MUST succeed before you consider the build complete.
If docker build fails, fix the issues and try again.

FILE WRITING: When creating files, avoid shell heredocs for files containing backticks.
Use 'cat > file' with properly escaped content, or write via Python if needed.
Do NOT escape backticks in JavaScript template literals - write them as literal ` characters.

Work autonomously. Do not ask for confirmation - just build it.
When you're done, create BUILD_COMPLETE.md with:
- What you built
- Docker build result (success/fail)
- How to run locally
