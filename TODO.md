## Mission Control Dashboard

**Idea:** Visual spread of projects - better than kanban

**Concept:**
- Tile/card layout showing all projects at a glance
- Status indicators (health, progress, blocked)
- Spatial grouping (by area, priority, or custom zones)
- Quick stats per project (tasks remaining, overdue, velocity)
- Dashboard overview vibe, not task-shuffling vibe
