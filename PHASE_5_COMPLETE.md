**Summary**
- Added visible sort indicators and proper columnheader wrappers for the sortable headings in `pages/mission/matrix.tsx:77` and `pages/mission/matrix.tsx:140`.
- Committed changes as “Phase 5: Matrix View”.

**Tests**
- `npm run build` (warns about Next.js workspace root inference due to multiple lockfiles).

**Notes**
- Working tree still has `BUILD_STATE.json` modified and `.codex-phase-5.md` untracked.
